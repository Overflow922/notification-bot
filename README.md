# notification-bot

Open source implementation of server that sends notifications based on some schedule. Schedule is configurable per user.
Currently, we are considering Telegram bot api as a main destination of generated notifications. But API is flexible
enough to add another destinations

## Schedule examples:

* 11:15
* 16:30 every day
* 10:00 every Monday

We do not support multi-language support at this stage.
